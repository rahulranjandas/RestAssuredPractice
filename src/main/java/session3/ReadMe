Path and Query parameters
--------------------------
- PathAndQueryParameters class is for identifying how to pass the path and query parameters in given and when conditions.
- One can pass multiple Query parameters and Path parameters in the endpoint
* Refer - PathAndQueryParameters.java

Cookies
--------
- Capture the API response in Response object using GET method.
- Adding validations on cookies because cookies are generally dynamic in nature. Validation such as isExists can be added.
- One cannot hardcode the cookies. If cookies are hardcoded, it fails.
java.lang.AssertionError: 1 expectation failed.
Expected cookie "AEC" was not "AVcja2eoeqclvEASepd2WRnwVnC-XYftzmHivqa-pRzv2cb0d74hajFxZTA", was "AVcja2fYw9faSKfjYjhrrpZHZ-MTtSXF3qLDA5LGhiiBQe8ySJvoCy0zCA".
- One can extract a single cookie or multiple cookies.
- response.getCookies() - returns cookies as a map.
* Recommended approach: Capture multiple cookies that are dynamic and iterate through using the keyset of the map.
* Refer - CookiesDemo.java


Headers
--------
- Adding .and() improves readability and implies chaining of multiple assertions. .and() does not add any functionality.
- response.getHeaders() returns all Headers that are of type Headers.
* Recommended approach: log all the headers using then().log().headers(); instead of log().all(); to print all the response headers.
    -log response body - then().log().body();
    -log response cookies - then().log().cookies();
* Refer - HeadersDemo.java and LoggingDemo.java
